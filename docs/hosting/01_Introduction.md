# Introduction to Hosting

## What is Hosting?

Hosting is a service that allows individuals or organizations to make their websites accessible on the internet. When you host a website, you store its files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, databases, etc.) on a server connected to the internet 24/7. When someone types your website’s domain name into a browser, the hosting server delivers the files to their device.

## How Hosting Works

1. **Website Creation:** You build your website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other technologies.
2. **Choose a Hosting Provider:** You rent space on a server from companies like Hostinger, GoDaddy, or AWS.  
3. **Upload Files:** Website files are uploaded to the hosting server using FTP or a control panel.  
4. **Connect Domain:** The domain name (e.g., `example.com`) is linked to the server using DNS.  
5. **Access by Visitors:** When users enter the domain name, the DNS finds the server’s IP address, and the website loads in their browser.

## Difference Between Domain and Hosting

| Feature | Domain | Hosting |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Definition** | The web address users type to visit your website (e.g., `example.com`) | The storage space where your website files are kept |
| **Purpose** | Identifies your website on the internet | Stores and serves website content |
| **Analogy** | Like a home address | Like the actual house |

**Example:**  
If your website is a house:  

- The **domain** is the address (`123 Street Name`).  
- The **hosting** is the land where the house (website files) sits.

## Components of Hosting

### 1. **Server**

A powerful computer that stores your website files and runs 24/7 to make your website available online.

### 2. **DNS (Domain Name System)**

Converts your domain name into an IP address that browsers use to find the hosting server.

### 3. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

A method used to upload and manage files on your hosting server. You can use tools like **FileZilla**.

### 4. **Control Panel**

A graphical interface (like **cPanel**, **Plesk**) provided by the hosting company to manage your website, emails, and databases.

### 5. **Database**

Stores dynamic website content such as user accounts, blog posts, or product data (e.g., **MySQL**, **MongoDB**).

## Importance of Hosting

- Keeps your website **accessible** 24/7
- Provides **storage** for your website files
- Ensures **speed and reliability** through server performance
- Offers **security features** like SSL, backups, and firewalls
- Allows **scaling** as your website grows

## Example Scenario

You build a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

1. You purchase a **domain** — `portfolio.com`  
2. You choose **hosting** — e.g., Netlify or Hostinger  
3. You **upload your files** to the hosting server  
4. When someone visits `portfolio.com`, the server sends your site’s files to their browser  

This is how hosting makes your website live on the internet.
